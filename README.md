# GCC Summer Classes 2023

CS135 (Intro to C/C++) and CS165 (Computer Architecture and Assembly)

CS/IS 135 is a course in programming using the C/C ++ languages, with uses in applications programming for real time, business, and image processing systems as well as  systems  programming. Types, operators, control flow functions, object-oriented  programming, classes, data abstraction, and program structure pointers and arrays are covered in the programming assignments. Lecture 2 hours/Laboratory 3 hours. 

CS/IS 165 introduces the student to computer architecture as well as the world of assembly 
language programming. The mapping of statements and constructs in a high-level language onto sequences of machine instructions is studied, as well as the internal representation of simple data types and structures. Numerical computation is examined, noting the various data representation errors and potential procedural errors. Lecture/Demonstration 4 hours.
